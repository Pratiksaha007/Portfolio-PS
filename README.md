I have created a dynamic and responsive portfolio website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to showcase my personal and professional profile. The website features a clean, modern design with smooth navigation and interactive elements that enhance user experience. It includes dedicated sections for my bio, skills, projects, resume, and contact information, all optimized for both desktop and mobile devices. The use of JavaScript adds dynamic functionality such as animations, scroll effects, and form validation, making the site more engaging and user-friendly. This portfolio serves as a digital resume to highlight my work and abilities effectively.
